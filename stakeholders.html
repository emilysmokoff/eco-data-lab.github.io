        <h2 class="normal">Our Stakeholders</h2>
        <div class="stakeholders">
            <p>Our project has two general stakeholders, the government and the general public. We began our project by conducting
                surveys of both stakeholder populations to understand their feelings toward consumption-based emissions, as well as what they
                hope to gain out of a CBEI Dashboard.
            </p>
            <h3>Government Officials</h3>
            <p>Our project was designed with the intention of furthering the design of EcoDataLabâ€™s
                 CBEI dashboard that presents government officials with data 
                 pertaining to their city/county regarding emissions. These visualizations show policy makers 
                 which consumption-based category emissions are the highest and the lowest. The dashboard's detailed breakdown of 
                  carbon emissions for different areas of interest help government officials and city planners make better informed policy decisions.
            </p>
        
            <h3>General Public</h3>
            <p> Regarding the general public, residents of a city can use the CBEI Dashboard's visualizations to gain insight and perspective on how they are contributing
                to carbon emissions. Especially when it comes to personal decisions that an individual can make in a given day, the statistics and data provided can help people make changes that are more enviornmently friendly. 
                Overall, the dashboard can provide general awareness of how a city's emission trends are doing and potentially spark change on a larger scale among communities.
