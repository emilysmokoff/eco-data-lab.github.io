        <h2 class="normal">Our Stakeholders</h2>
        <div class="stakeholders">
            <p>Our project has two general stakeholders, the government and the general public. We began our project by conducting
                surveys of both stakeholder populations to understand their understanding of carbon emissions, as well as what they
                hoped to gain out of a CBEI Dashboard.
            </p>
            <h3>Government Officials</h3>
            <p>We addressed our problem statement by furthering the design of EcoDataLabâ€™s
                 CBEI dashboard that presents government officials with data 
                 pertaining to their city/county regarding emissions. These visualizations also show policy makers 
                 which categories emissions are highest and lowest. The more specific breakdown of 
                  carbon emissions for different areas of interest help government officials and city planners make better informed policy decisions.
            </p>
        
            <h3>General Public</h3>
            <p> Regarding the general public, residents of a city can use the CBEI Dashboards visualizations to gain insight and perspective on how they are contributing
                to carbon emissions. Especially when it comes to personal decisions that an individual can make in a given day, the statistics and data provided can help people make changes that are more enviornmently friendly. 
                Also, this can provide a general awareness of how a city's emission trends are doing and potentially spark change on a larger scale among communities.
