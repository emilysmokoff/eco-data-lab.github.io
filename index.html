            <p>We are a group of five individuals who are passionate about the environment and esuring we are leaving 
                a positive mark on the world. We were lucky enough to be paired with our sponsor, EcoDataLab, whose mission is to 
                to address climate change by massively scaling data science solutions.

            <h2>Our Sponsor</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.ecodatalab.com/">EcoDataLab</a></h3>
            <p>Throughout this project we worked with EcoDataLab, and specifically their co-founder Ben Gould. Their goal is to empower 
                action among governments, organizations, and individuals. We leverage state-of-the-art research, data, and technology to 
                help communities understand their complete carbon footprints and take the most effective actions to reduce their 
                environmental impacts.
            </p>

            <h2>What is our project?</h2>
            <p>Our project was to work on our Sponsors pre-exisitng CBEI Dashboard. We were tasked with providing our sponosr 
                with recommendations of ways to improve their existing solution, as well as looking through census data to 
                construct three new deep dive pages into categories of interest that did not exist prior.
