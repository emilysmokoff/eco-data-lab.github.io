            <p>We are a group of five individuals who are passionate about the environment and ensuring we are leaving 
                a positive mark on the world. We were lucky enough to be paired with our sponsor, EcoDataLab, whose mission is to 
                to address climate change by massively scaling data science solutions.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Sponsor</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.ecodatalab.com/">EcoDataLab</a></h3>
            <p>Throughout this project we worked with EcoDataLab, and specifically their co-founder Ben Gould. Their goal is to empower 
                action among governments, organizations, and individuals. They leverage state-of-the-art research, data, and technology to 
                help communities understand their complete carbon footprints and take the most effective actions to reduce their 
                environmental impacts.
            </p>

            <h2>What is our project?</h2>
            <p>Government officials are currently searching for consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions analysis that is 
                comprehensive, so that they can make educated carbon emission policy decisions for their city. Our sponsor, 
                EcoDataLab, has created a Consumption-Based Emissions Inventory (CBEI) Dashboard that allows city officials to understand their carbon emissions data through 
                visualizations that would previously have been very complicated to comprehend.

            </p>
            <p>
                Our team helped EcoDataLab by making 
                recommendations on their current platforms design and accessibility features, while also creating housing, transportation, 
                and US data pages for their site that allow officials to make informed policy decisions in each respective area. In order
                to create the three new deep dive pages, we sifted through census data and established categories of interest.
