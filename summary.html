            <p>Our project was split into two quarters. During the first quarter we produced our MVP, and during the second quarter we further developed our MVP.
            </p>
            <h3>Quarter One</h3>
            <p>During our first quarter, we focused on developing our MVP. This included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interviewing Stakeholders to learn what more they wanted from our sponsors site.</strong> In addition to this we also conducted Market Research and Literature Review to learn what components of current environment dashboards were most beneficial.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing mockups for 4 Deep Dive Pages.</strong> We developed mockups for a housing page, a transportation page, a United States Deep Dive page, and a page dedicated to steps members in a community could take to reduce their carbon footprint.</li>
                <li><strong>Investigating accessibility concerns on the site</strong>, and building mock-ups of improvements. This included changing the color gradient of bar graphs, as well as finding areas of the site that were not screen reader friendly.</li>
                <li><strong>Developing mockups of our recommendations for the site.</strong> This included changes such as an indicator bar on the site menu, breaking up pages into subcategories, and reformatting the map page.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiling our Design Hand-Off Documentation.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Check out some of our mock-ups below!</p>

            <h3>Quarter Two</h3>
            <p>During our second quarter, we focused on developing the most important designs from our MVP. This included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developing 3 of our Deep Dive Pages:</strong> the housing page, transportation page, and United States breakdown page. These pages are now built out using React and present on our teams branch of our sponsors GitHub repository.</li>
                <li><strong>User testing our new Deep Dive Pages.</strong> We had users walk through our new pages and find areas that required change, were unintuitive, or that they believed should be done differently. We then reformatted the pages based on the results we received from this testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiling our Coding Hand-Off Documentation.</strong></li>
            </ul>
