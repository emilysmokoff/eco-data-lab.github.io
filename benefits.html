            <ul>
                <li> Three new Deep Dive Pages on the climate dashboard. Our three new pages were created based on user and market research in combination with interested trends and pattern found in data. We decided these three categories would create desirable and interesting data for stakeholders and provide valuable insights used for policy change.   </li>
                <li> US Deep Dive Page: Stakeholders can visualize, track, and understand how their local emissions and trends compares to national averages and statistics. Stakeholders can drive policy change based on how their local data compares. </li>
                <li> Trasportation Deep Dive Page: Stakeholders can explore transportation data in depth. Including average times of commute, and commuting modes broken down both by the whole population as well as by age groups. </li>
                <li> Housing Deep Dive Page: Stakeholders can explore housing data in depth. Including which subcategories make up housing emissions, housing cost burden data, how year a house is built, household income, and home ownership affects emissions </li>
                <li> Increased focus on accessibility and design. </li>
            </ul>
